When moving your WordPress site to a new domain or server, you will likely run into a need to run a search/replace on the database for everything to work correctly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Using Better Search Replace =

Once activated, Better Search Replace will add a page under the "Tools" menu page in your WordPress admin.

= Is my host supported? =

Yes! This plugin should be compatible with any host.

= Can I damage my site with this plugin? =

Yes! Entering a wrong search or replace string could damage your database. Because of this, it is always adviseable to have a backup of your database before using this plugin.

= How does this work on WordPress Multisite? =

When running this plugin on a WordPress Multisite installation, it will only be loaded and visible for Network admins. Network admins can go to the dashboard of any subsite to run a search/replace on just the tables for that subsite, or go to the dashboard of the main/base site to run a search/replace on all tables.

= How can I use this plugin when changing URLs? =

If you're moving your site from one server to another and changing the URL of your WordPress installation, the approach below allows you to do so easily without affecting the old site:

1. Backup the database on your current site
2. Install the database on your new host
3. On the new host, define the new site URL in the `wp-config.php` file, as shown [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_The_Site_URL#Edit_wp-config.php)
4. Log in at your new admin URL and run Better Search Replace on the old site URL for the new site URL
5. Delete the site_url constant you added to `wp-config.php`. You may also need to regenerate your .htaccess by going to Settings -> Permalinks and saving the settings.
