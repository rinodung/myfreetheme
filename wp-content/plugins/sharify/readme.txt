= Sharing Buttons =

Sharify adds responsive and beautiful sharing buttons to your WordPress posts and pages. The buttons are responsive which looks beautiful on every device and theme. The plugin includes sharing buttons for Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest and VKontake. Sharify also provides buttons for Reddit submit, Pocket and even Email.

= Fast =

Sharify is the fastest sharing plugin for WordPress. The plugin comes with caching which makes your site load faster and reduce server load. Sharify's Caching will cache the sharing counts - which you can disable from the admin panel. You can also change the caching period from the Sharify Admin Panel.

= Admin Panel =

Sharify comes with an admin panel where you can customize any settings you want. You can display and hide any sharing button you want. You can also disable caching and change the cache period. I'll be adding more options to the admin panel soon as well!

= Weekly Updates =

I update the plugin weekly to add new feature and fix bugs. You'll never face any problem with the plugin as we try to fix and release an update for every important bugs as soon as possible!
