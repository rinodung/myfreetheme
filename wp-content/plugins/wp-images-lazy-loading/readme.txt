WordPress optimization plugin that enables jQuery image lazy loading.

== Description ==

The WordPress images lazy loading plugin (WPILL) enables the jQuery lazy loading of images to improve page load times and increase your Google PageSpeed Score. It delays loading of images outside of the viewport (visible part of a web page). These images won't be loaded before the user scrolls down to them. Using WPILL on long pages containing many large images makes the page load much faster. It will also reduce server load and save some bandwidth.
